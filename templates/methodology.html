        <h2>How we generate our Correct Score Heatmaps</h2>
        <p>
            Our match predictions are based on a statistical model that simulates thousands of possible 
            outcomes using historical data, team performance metrics, and expected goals (xG). To generate 
            the likelyhood of each team scoring a certain number of goals in a given fixture, we use a 
            <strong>Poisson distribution</strong>, a method widely used in football analytics to estimate 
            goal probabilities.
        </p>
        <br><br><br><br>
        <h2>What Data is Used?</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Historical Match Data</strong> - Gives an insight to a teams overall performance. <br> 
            <strong>Expected Goals (xG) Data</strong> - Measures the quality of goal scoring oppertunities. <br>
            <strong>Team Form</strong> - Recent performances will influence predictions, along with how injury & suspension can impact a Team's strength. <br>
            <strong>Home & Away Performance</strong> - Home field advantage can also have an impact. <br>
        </p>
        <br><br><br><br>
        <h2>How is this Data used?</h2>
        <p>
            We look at a Teams overall performance from all the available match data we have over the seasons. 
            We factor in Recent form and assign each team with an Attack Rating and a Defence Rating.
            This measures a teams strength against the rest of the league. 
            <br><br>
            We can then determine how many goals
            a team will need to score in a given fixture in order to keep their rating the same - this is a teams XG.
            From this, we are able to run a Poisson Distribution and determinethe likelyhood of each team scoring
            a certain number of goals in a fixture.
            <br><br>
            We can display these together on a heatmap so visualize the most 
            likely outcomes based on our model.
        </p>
        <br><br><br><br>
        <h2>Why Use a Heatmap?</h2>
        <p>
            Our prediction heatmaps visually display the most likely scorelines, making it easier to 
            interpret probabilities at a glance. Darker shades indicate more probable outcomes, helping 
            users quickly understand match expectations beyond just win/loss probabilities.

        <h2>How Can You Use This Data?</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Fans & Analysts</strong> – Gain data-driven insights into matches. Understand how likely a team is to win or lose based on statistical modeling.
            Compare expected vs. actual performance to spot underrated teams or over valued players.<br><br>
            <strong>FPL Players</strong> – Identify potential goal-heavy matches. Spot fixtures where high xG suggests multiple goals, making certain players strong captain choices.
            Identify teams likely to keep clean sheets, helping with defensive picks.
            Use injury & suspension data to see if key attacking players are missing, reducing a team's goal threat.<br><br>
            <strong>Betting & Predictions</strong> – Use probability models rather than intuition. Instead of relying on gut feeling, use our win probabilities and score predictions to find value bets.
            Identify overrated or underrated odds by comparing bookmaker lines with our model's output.
            Use the heatmap to assess how likely specific scorelines are before betting on correct scores or over/under markets.
